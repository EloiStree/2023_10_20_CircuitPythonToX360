Search about how I can create a fake x360 controller from Circuit Python that would be controlled by an other device. 


( Was almost there but I miss some skills and knowledge to do it.  
Stopped because I don't have time for that at the moment.    
And because I spent time trying to add the trigger without success.  
Will come back on it eventually.  )
